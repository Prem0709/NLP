# spaCy NLP Project ‚Äì In-Depth Overview

This project uses **spaCy**, a high-performance and production-grade library for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in Python. It's widely used in the industry for tasks such as information extraction, chatbot development, document analysis, and more.

## üîç What is spaCy?

- **spaCy** is an **open-source NLP library** designed for real-world usage.
- Developed by **Explosion AI**, it focuses on performance, simplicity, and scalability.
- Unlike NLTK, which is more educational, spaCy is optimized for **industrial-strength NLP applications**.

## üß† Core Concepts in spaCy

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Tokenization** | Splits text into tokens (words, punctuation, etc.) |
| **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)** | Identifies grammatical roles of words (noun, verb, etc.) |
| **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | Detects entities like names, dates, money, organizations |
| **Dependency Parsing** | Analyzes syntactic structure and grammatical relationships |
| **Lemmatization** | Converts words to their base/root form |
| **Sentence Segmentation** | Detects sentence boundaries automatically |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How spaCy Works (Architecture)

- **Pipeline Architecture**: Text is processed through a pipeline of components (e.g., tokenizer ‚Üí tagger ‚Üí parser ‚Üí NER).
- You can add/remove custom components via `nlp.add_pipe()`.
- Models are pre-trained and loaded via `spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")`.

Example:
```python
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002.")

for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)

for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
